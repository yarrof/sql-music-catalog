## Story

Chinook is a digital media store which has all sorts of tracks
and playlists from around the world for sale. You are a member of the Data

## What are you going to learn?

- How to answer complex business questions using advanced SQL commands
- How to join database tables (`JOIN`)
- How to use aliases (`AS`)
- How to group results to use aggregated functions (`GROUP BY`, `COUNT`)
- How to order rows (`ORDER BY`)
- How to filter aggregated results (`HAVING`)
- How to use some PostgreSQL specific aggregate functions (`ARRAY_AGG`, `STRING_AGG`)

## Tasks

1. Run the `chinook_data.sql` script to create the tables and seed it with data.
    - After executing the script the same database schema are created as you see in the `data/chinook-database-schema.png`

2. Write a query to create an `Account` table to store the account's `Username` and `Password`. Every record should have a unique ID.
    - After executing the script the `Account` table exists:
```
+----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| AccountId(int) | Username(varchar(50)) | Password(varchar(20)) |
+----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
```
    - The SQL command(s) are saved in a file called `create-account-table.sql`

3. Write a query which adds a new column to the `Customer` table. This column should store the `AccountId` as an integer.
    - After executing the script the `Customer` table contains an `AccountId` column
    - The SQL command(s) are saved in a file called `add-column-to-customer.sql`

4. Write a query which adds a foreign key constraint between the `Account` and the `Customer` tables.
    - Customer's `AccountId` is a foreign key
    - Account's ID is the Account's primary key
    - There is a connection between `CustomerId` and `AccountId`
    - The SQL command(s) are saved in a file called `add-foreign-key-constraint.sql`

5. Write a query which adds a column to the `Track` table. The new column's name is `IsLarge` and its type is `BOOLEAN`
    - The `Track` table contains an `IsLarge` field
```
+------------------+
| IsLarge(BOOLEAN) |
+------------------+
```
    - The SQL command(s) are saved in a file called `add-islarge-column.sql`

6. Write a query to update every record's `IsLarge` field in the `Track` table.
    - `IsLarge` is `true` where `Bytes` is greater or equal than 10000000
    - `IsLarge` is `false` where `Bytes` is smaller than 10000000
    - The SQL command(s) are saved in a file called `update-track-islarge.sql`

7. Create a query to show each customer's full name and city. List customers and their location (city). Display the full name of the customers and the name of the city they live in.
    - Only customers from `Canada` are shown in the results

  Edward    | Francis  | Ottawa
  Martha    | Silk     | Halifax
  Aaron     | Mitchell | Winnipeg
  Ellie     | Sullivan | Yellowknife
  (8 rows)
  ```
    - The result of your query contains 8 rows
    - The SQL command(s) are saved in a file called `query-costumer-by-country.sql`

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You can find the SQL file with the sample data in the data folder.
  To use it, create a new database for this project and use `psql` to
  execute the SQL commands in that file:
    - Start `psql` in a terminal at the `data` folder of the project
    - Connect to your already created new database eg. `\connect chinook`
    - Execute the commands in the sql file `\i chinook_data.sql`
